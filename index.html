            <h1>My name is Ishraq, which means Sunshine in Arabic</h1>
            <p>During my college years, I learned many CS skills from lectures as I used to study out of passion and love for the field, I gained online skills as well such as web development and android development, machine learning, and I made my first game from java that used GUI.<br><br>From the student activity, I was enrolled in, I learned a lot about project management, BMC, and presentation skills as I became the head of the presentation committee afterward, then I was elected as the president of Enactus Modern Academy due to my hard work and ability to make members feel home, work hard, and see the outcome of their efforts.<br><br>During my Junior year, I became the Lead at GDSC Modern Academy in Maadi. I'm passionate about full-stack (specially backend) web development and I've made many projects with my own hands. During my year as a GDSC Lead I was an instructor for students at my campus in a full-stack web development course. I worked with multiple backend stacks and I was also a backend intern which gave me much experience in a working environment.</p>
